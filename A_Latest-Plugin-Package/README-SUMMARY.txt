# Legal Document Automation Plugin - Comprehensive Project Summary

## Project Goals
- All mapped merge tags (including split, filtered, and conditional) must be replaced in every DOCX part (main, header, footer).
- The merged DOCX must preserve all template formatting: front page, header, footer, section breaks, and styles.
- The plugin must not cause fatal or critical errors in WordPress.
- Version numbers must be consistent across all plugin files and folders.

## What Has Been Tried
### Successful Approaches
- Diagnostics: Robust logging for unreplaced tags, modifier failures, and XML structure changes.
- Conservative split tag logic: Avoids corrupting XML and only reconstructs verified split tags.
- Dynamic mapping: Merge tags are mapped from backend form fields and the `current-mapping` folder.

### Unsuccessful/Problematic Approaches
- Aggressive nuclear fixes: Over-aggressive regex in headers/footers caused formatting loss and missed tags.
- Restoration after merge: Attempting to restore formatting nodes after tag replacement did not reliably preserve formatting.
- Undefined functions/methods: Caused fatal errors in WordPress (e.g., `wp_mkdir_p`, `formatPhoneNumber`).
- Processing each XML part in isolation: Broke relationships between sections, headers, and footers.

## Key Lessons
- Only touch merge tagsâ€”never alter or remove any other XML nodes (especially `<w:sectPr>`, `<w:style>`, and formatting).
- Use conservative split tag reconstruction everywhere, including headers/footers.
- Always check for undefined functions/methods and fallback safely.
- Validate merged output against the original template for formatting and tag replacement.
- Always review history and previous fixes to avoid repeating mistakes.

## Version Control
- Always check and update version numbers in all plugin files and folders for consistency.
- Ensure the plugin version matches across main PHP files, readme, and packaging.

## Testing Instructions
- Use the template from `templates/Confidentiality-Agreement-One-Way.docx` for all tests.
- Validate merged output against the original template for formatting and tag replacement.
- Use all available resources: logs, diagnostics, extracted XML, and WordPress backend mapping.
- Review diagnostics for unreplaced tags, modifier failures, and formatting node changes.
- Compare merged and template DOCX structure and content.
